<li><u><b>Central Procesing Unit</b></u>- or CPU, is often referred to as the computers brain. 
It controls the number of tasks your computer can accomplish at once and how quickly it can complete said 
tasks.When choseing a CPU you have to reserch what platform is best for you witch ther is only two (Intel and AMD) 
The other factor witch will go for each part, the buget of the buil witch the CPU should be one fo the most 
expensive other than the GPU.</li>

<li><u><b>Graphics Processing Unit</b></u>- also known as the GPU, graphics card, or video card, is an amazing 
component. Not only does it look cool, but it lets you play games and rendering tasks like video editing with out  
crashing your computer or slowing your gameplay or workload.There are sites that stress-test graphics cards 
and publish reviews pointing out flaws in aesthetics and execution. Reading these is a great way to figure out 
what card to buy.</li>

<li><u><b>Random Access Memory</b></u>-or RAM allows computers to access files quickly and run multiple processes at once 
without lagging.You will want at least 4GB of RAM for your computer. Anything less than that and many games will not 
run and rendering will take exremly long. As an upper limit, most online enthusiasts agree that 16GB of RAM is more 
than enough for your gaming and editing needs. Check out the motherboards specs to determine how many RAM sticks you 
need and what speeds and types are available. Generaly the more ghz the faster the RAM can acomplish tasks. 
</li>

<li><u><b>Motherboard</b></u>-The motherboard houses the various components of your gaming PC.A motherboard will take the
difrent pc components and sit them down in their proper places, and helps them work together.Take some time to 
think ahead about the other members of your PC family-like the video card, memory, and other components you want to  
choose a motherboard that accommodates them. The will not only need to support the cpu brand but the socket type as well </li>

<li><u><b>Storage</b></u>-It can be tricky to know exactly how much storage you will need. Make your best guess. 
Look at how much space your current pc requires, add the apps or games you want to get and use that as a bench mark.
Then you can buy either a hard drive or a solid-state drive (SSD). Some sources recommend combining a lower-end 
SSD with a hard drive for the best of both worlds. But if you can cover your storage needs with an SSD alone, it may be 
helpful to go this route, as these drives can halve loading times, no problem.If this sounds overwhelming, do not worry. 
It will be possible to add storage to your PC in the future.</li>

<li><u><b>Power Supply</b></u>-You are going to need to harness the power of electricity to bring your PC to life. This is 
where a quality power supply unit, or PSU, comes into play. Avoid settling for the cheapest PSU to plug into your new 
machine. If you buy nice components, but penny-pinch for your power supply, you may find that you have literally torched 
your investment.</li>

<li><u><b>Case</b></u>-The computer case is where everything comes together. Like a good power source, a nice case can last 
you multiple rebuilds over many years.To invest in your "forever" case, look for one that is made of metal rather than plastic, 
with plenty of space on the inside to keep your current components ventilated while leaving room for future replacement parts.And, 
of course, always check the reviews. It can be tricky to tell from an online photo how well a piece will perform when you have 
it under your desk.</li>
